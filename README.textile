h1. Activity log

bq. "There is nothing so terrible as activity without insight."
-- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 

h2. What is it about?

The activity log plugin enables an Rails application to log actions on records. This is
not restricted to the default @create@, @update@, @delete@ methods, but can be
used for custom methods too.

If you want to keep track of changes (actually not _what_ is changed, but _that_ something was
changed) this plugin might be helpful.

h2. Installation

<pre>
script/plugin install git://github.com/chlu/activity_log.git
</pre>

* Run the plugin migration: @rake db:migrate:plugins@
* Add an @acts_as_activity_loggable@ call to your active record class at the _bottom_
* Customize the activity view and controller

h2. Example

h3. In your model:

<pre>
class Thingybob < ActiveRecord::Base
  def foo
    # Do something useful here
  end

  # If something goes wrong inside a method, it isn't tracked  
  def bar
    transaction do
      foo
      raise "Barrr!"
    end
  end
  
  # Activity entries don't stack, so a "bzz!" doesn't create an "update" entry
  def bzz!
    self.name = "Bzz!"
    save
  end

  # This is the magic. If you show your current user object, it will be tracked
  acts_as_activity_loggable [:create, :update, :foo, :bar, :'bzz!'],
  	:load_user => lambda { User.current }
end
</pre>

h3. In your controller (or model):

<pre>
bob = Thingybob.find(id)
@last_action = bob.activity_log.last.action
</pre>
